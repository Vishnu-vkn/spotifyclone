# 🎵 Spotify Clone (Web Application)

A Spotify-inspired web music player built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project was developed as a **learning-focused project** to strengthen my understanding of JavaScript by building a real-world application.

Along with core music player features, I implemented **mobile app–style media responsiveness**, which is not originally available in the Spotify web version.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This Spotify Clone allows users to play music from playlists, navigate between songs, and experience a responsive UI similar to a mobile music app.  
Playlists and songs are loaded dynamically using **JSON**, making the project more scalable and structured.

> ⚠️ This is a frontend-only project created for educational purposes and does not use the official Spotify API.

## 🧠 What I Learned from This Project

By building this project, I learned and practiced:
- JavaScript fundamentals through real implementation
- DOM manipulation and event handling
- Audio playback control using JavaScript
- Loading and managing data using JSON
- Creating playlists dynamically
- Building responsive layouts for mobile devices
- Debugging and structuring frontend projects

This project helped me move from **basic JavaScript knowledge to hands-on experience**.
